**Requirement:**  
A general description of the AI system, its intended purpose, and the system's overall logic.

**Documentation Mapping:**  

- [`overview.md`](overview.md) â€“ Provides a high-level description of Neolens' purpose (medical image analysis), technical logic, and user base.  
- [`use-cases-by-industry.md`](../ai-insights/use-cases-by-industry.md) â€“ Lists specific real-world scenarios across clinical sectors.  

---

### 2. System Development and Training

**Requirement:**  
Information about the development process, training data sources, and data governance.

**Documentation Mapping:**  

- [`ai-concepts.md`](../ai-insights/ai-concepts.md) â€“ Clarifies key terms related to model training and data handling.  
- [`configuring-ai.md`](../ai-insights/configuring-ai.md) â€“ Explains parameterization and configuration logic.  
- [`ai-limitations.md`](../ai-insights/ai-limitations.md) â€“ States known limitations, biases, and performance considerations.

---

### 3. Technical Parameters and Configurability

**Requirement:**  
A detailed description of the systemâ€™s configuration, settings, and limits.

**Documentation Mapping:**

- [`configuring-ai.md`](../ai-insights/configuring-ai.md) â€“ Presents the types of configurable parameters and use cases.  
- [`interpreting-results.md`](../ai-insights/interpreting-results.md) â€“ Explains how parameter changes affect outputs.

---

### 4. Human Oversight Measures

**Requirement:**  
Details of how human oversight is ensured during AI usage.

**Documentation Mapping:**  

- [`best-practices.md`](../ai-insights/best-practices.md) â€“ Lists recommended human interventions and verification workflows.  
- [`ai-troubleshooting.md`](../ai-insights/ai-troubleshooting.md) â€“ Supports diagnostic guidance for human operators.

---

### 5. System Performance and Accuracy

**Requirement:**  
Information on accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity resilience.

**Documentation Mapping:**

---

### 7. Record-Keeping and Traceability

**Requirement:**  
Mechanisms for logging, traceability, and version control.

**Documentation Mapping:**  

- [`authentification.md`](../getting-started/authentification.md) â€“ Details how API calls are authenticated and logged.  
- [`api-troubleshooting.md`](../api-reference/api-troubleshooting.md) â€“ Explains how logs are used for error diagnosis.

---

### 8. Post-Market Monitoring

**Requirement:**  
Plans and mechanisms to monitor the system after deployment.

**Documentation Mapping:**

- _(Simulated)_ This demo documentation assumes a monitoring plan exists but is not implemented in this fictional example. Placeholder section may be added later.

## Disclaimer

> ðŸ§ª This documentation is part of a fictional portfolio project. It does **not** represent a real medical device or AI system, and is **not legally certified** under the AI Act. However, it is intentionally structured to simulate conformity with **Annex IV** of the EU AI Act to demonstrate good documentation practices.
