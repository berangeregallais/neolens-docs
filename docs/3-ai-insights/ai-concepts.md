### Glossary of Core Concepts

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
A broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of tasks that typically require human intelligence.

**Machine Learning (ML)**  
A subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to improve performance without explicit programming.

**Deep Learning**  
A type of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to analyze data, especially useful for images and signals.

**Computer Vision**  
The field of AI focused on enabling machines to interpret and process visual information from images or videos.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
A deep learning architecture commonly used for image analysis tasks like detection, segmentation, and classification.

**Image Segmentation**  
Dividing an image into meaningful parts or regions, such as organs or anomalies.

**Object Detection**  
Locating and identifying specific features or abnormalities in an image (e.g., nodules, lesions).

**Classification**  
Assigning categories or labels to images or regions (e.g., benign vs malignant).

**Anomaly Detection**  
Automatically identifying data points or regions that deviate from expected patterns in medical images.

**Multimodal Learning**  
Combining multiple data types (e.g., imaging + text) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

**NLP (Natural Language Processing)**  
A branch of AI used to understand and generate human language—used in Neolens to generate reports or interpret clinical notes.

**Attention Mechanisms**  
Model components that help focus on the most relevant parts of an image or input.

**Uncertainty Estimation**  
Quantifying how confident the model is in its predictions—critical for clinical risk management.

**Explainability**  
The degree to which the internal mechanics of an AI model can be interpreted by humans.

**Bias and Fairness**  
The study of whether a model performs consistently across different patient populations and imaging contexts.
