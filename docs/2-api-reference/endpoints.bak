## API Endpoints

The Neolens API is organized around RESTful principles. All endpoints are versioned under `/v1/` and respond with JSON by default. Secure communication over HTTPS is required for all requests.

### Base URL

  -F "file=@brain-mri.dcm"
```

This endpoint accepts DICOM, PNG, and JPEG formats. File size must not exceed 100MB.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

All endpoints require OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. Make sure your token is scoped correctly for the endpoint you're calling.

If you receive a `403 Forbidden` response, it may be due to:

- Insufficient scope
- A restricted endpoint for your user role
- A deactivated API key

Contact [support@neolens.ai](mailto:support@neolens.ai) for custom role configurations.
