### Core functionalities

Neolens provides modular capabilities that can be used independently or in combination:

- üìç **Detection**: Identify regions of interest or abnormalities in medical images  
- üß† **Classification**: Categorize detected findings using clinically relevant labels  
- üìè **Measurement**: Compute anatomical distances, volumes, or angles with precision  
- üìù **Report Generation**: Automatically generate structured reports from results  
- üîí **Traceability**: Store, audit, and retrieve prediction history for legal safety  

Each module includes clear endpoints, parameter configuration options, and interpretation guidance.

### Compliance and integration

Neolens is engineered for the regulated healthcare environment:

- Full compliance with GDPR and medical device regulations (MDR)  
- Secure authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0 and API key management  
- Extensive audit logging and traceability to support clinical governance  
- Modular design for easy integration with hospital IT ecosystems (HL7, FHIR compatible)
