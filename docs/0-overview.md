## Neolens — Intelligent Medical Imaging API Overview

Neolens is a high-performance medical imaging analysis API leveraging advanced AI models to support clinical decision-making and healthcare workflows.

### Target audience

- **Radiologists & Clinical Experts:** Access precise anomaly detection, pathology classification, and anatomical measurements powered by deep learning models trained on large-scale medical datasets.  
- **Healthcare IT & System Integrators:** Integrate seamlessly with PACS, RIS, and EHR systems via secure RESTful APIs, compliant with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.  
- **Developers & Data Scientists:** Utilize a fully documented OpenAPI specification supporting multipart image uploads, customizable inference parameters, and real-time results streaming.  
- **Researchers & AI Engineers:** Explore model architecture details, uncertainty quantification methods, and algorithmic limitations documented transparently for reproducibility and ethical deployment.

### Core functionalities

- **Anomaly Detection & Localization:** Employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-level segmentation and detection of lesions, nodules, and other pathologies.  
- **Pathology Prioritization:** Apply hierarchical classification algorithms to rank findings by clinical urgency, optimizing triage processes.  
- **Automated Anatomical Measurement:** Extract precise metrics (e.g., lesion size, volume) using geometric and morphological analysis pipelines.  
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** Perform comparative studies across timepoints, leveraging image registration and temporal modeling.  
- **Preliminary Report Generation:** Generate structured, NLP-powered summaries compatible with clinical documentation standards.  
- **Diagnostic Confidence Scores:** Provide calibrated confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates based on Bayesian deep learning techniques.

### Compliance and integration

Neolens is engineered for the regulated healthcare environment:

- Full compliance with GDPR and medical device regulations (MDR)  
- Secure authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0 and API key management  
- Extensive audit logging and traceability to support clinical governance
